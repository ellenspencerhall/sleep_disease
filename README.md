# Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, Sleep and Mental Health

## Background
Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease are two common neurodegenerative diseases, affecting many individuals worldwide. Alzheimer's disease is characterised by a loss of cognitive functioning and the ability to carry out every day activities. Parkinson's disease is a condition whereby individuals are unable to control their movements, leading to difficulties initiating and coordinating movement, shaking, stiffness and other behavioural changes. Research has extensively been conducted regarding these two diseases, and a common finding suggests that both diseases are associated with various sleep disturbances and disorders (Peter-Derex et al., 2015; Comella, 2007).


## Data origins
The raw data that was used for this project was obtained from the open science framework (OSF). The authors, Hayley Owens and Eric Youngstrom, uploaded the data from their project titled ‘Length of sleep as a factor of Alzheimer’s and Dementia’ which was conducted at the University of North Carolina in 2019. These researched conducted a secondary analysis of a subset of data from Waite et al. (2014) which was gathered from interviews and biomeasurements. The aim of Owens' and Youngstrom's research project was to assess the relationship between sleep, Alzheimer's disease, dementia and Parkinson's disease. 

## Research Question
This aim of this project was to explore how length of sleep differed between those with neither disease, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and both diseases. Furthermore, this project also aimed to assess how mental health influenced length of sleep in these diseases.
